      <li>You confirm your preferred time</li>

    </ul>

    </ul>

    <h2>6. Care Assessments and Recommendations</h2>
    <p>The care assessments and facility recommendations provided by Compass Place are:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Based on the information you provide about your parent's needs</li>
      <li>Generated by our matching algorithm, not by medical professionals</li>
      <li>Intended as decision support, not medical advice</li>
    </ul>
    <p>You should consult with healthcare providers for medical decisions about your parent's care needs.</p>

    <h2>7. Facility Information</h2>
    <p>We strive to provide accurate facility information, including:</p>

      <li>State inspection summaries</li>

    </ul>
    <p>You should verify all information directly with facilities before making decisions.</p>

    <h2>8. Referral Fees and Neutrality</h2>
    <p>Compass Place earns referral fees from facilities when a user's parent moves in. We are committed to transparency:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Facilities cannot pay for better rankings.</strong> Our matching algorithm ranks facilities based on fit, not payment.</li>
      <li><strong>Referral fees are disclosed.</strong> When you select a facility, we inform you that we may receive a fee.</li>
      <li><strong>Your data is never sold.</strong> We do not sell your information to facilities or third parties.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>9. User Conduct</h2>
    <p>You agree not to:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Provide false information about yourself, your parent, or loved one</li>
      <li>Use the App for any purpose other than finding senior living care</li>
      <li>Attempt to access data of other users</li>
      <li>Interfere with or reverse-engineer the App</li>
      <li>Use the App for advertising or commercial purposes without permission</li>
      <li>Harass facilities or other users</li>
    </ul>
